#Vision statement:<br><br>
#Motivation:<br><br>
#Risks:<br><br>
1. Project will be based on Java but only half of our group have learned java before.<br>
2. No prior experience working with the people on the team.<br>
3. Lake of experience on building a Chrome extension.<br>

#Mitigation strategy:<br><br>
1. Learn Java and how to make Chromeextension from online tutorial<br>
2. Allocate the works properly based on each member's experience on Java.<br>
3. Hold group meeting oftenly<br>

#User stories:<br><br>
1. As a student, I want to manage many chrome tabs at once so that I can be more efficient at researching while working on assignments.<br>

2. As a user, I want my tabs to be organized so that I can quickly find what I am looking for. <br>

3. As a user, I want to see the full title of all my tabs in one place so that I can decide whether to to close them or keep them open quickly.<br>

4. As a user, I want to temporarily save my tabs without bookmarking so that I can continue a browsing experience where I left off when I want to.<br>  

5. As a developer, I want to utilize an environment that has clear and extensive documentation so that development does not waste time.<br>     
6. As a non-associated developer, I want to be able to see the software's code so I can give constructive feedback to make the extension better.<br>
