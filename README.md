# Title:<br>
Make Your Wish Lists Come True - A Website to Save All of Your Wish Lists<br><br>

# Description:<br>
This is a website that does the following jobs: <br>
1.	Save the item that the users want to purchase from all-over the website into a wish list; <br>
2.	The users can save the items in different categories; <br>
3.	The users can give short names, prices, choices of on sale or not, and description(to save item's links) of the items they are interested in to purchase; <br>
4.	The users can log in through Google Accounts to save their wish lists. The wish lists will be saved when the users exit the website.<br><br>

# Vision statement:<br>
We save all your wish lists. Because when you have money, there is always something you want to buy. <br><br>

# Motivation:<br>
A wish list of a certain online shopping website can only save the items of that specific website. When it comes to purchase, buyers would have to go to different shopping websites first, then check the wish lists. That costs time and sometimes difficult to remember at which website you have the wish lists saved. Our product means to save shoppersâ€™ time and helps the shoppers to easily find what they liked.
