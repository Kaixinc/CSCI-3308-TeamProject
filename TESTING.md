#Title:<br>
Make your wish lists come true - Google Chrome Extension<br><br>

#Description:<br>
This is a Google Chrome extension that does the following jobs: <br>
1.	Save the item that the users want to purchase into a wish list, that item could be from any website; <br>
2.	The users can create tabs of different categories to save the items in; <br>
3.	The users can give short names of the items they are interest in to purchase; <br>
4.	The wish lists will be saved when the users exit Google Chrome.<br><br>

#Vision statement:<br>
We save all your wish lists. Because when you have money, there is always something you want to buy. <br><br>

#Motivation:<br>
A wish list of a certain online shopping website can only save the items of that specific website. When it comes to purchase, buyers would have to go to different shopping websites first, then check the wish lists. That costs time and sometimes difficult to remember at which website you have the wish lists saved. Our product means to save shoppersâ€™ time and helps the shoppers to easily find what they liked.

#Risks:<br><br>
1. Project will be based on Java but only half of our group have experienced Java before.<br>
2. No prior experience working with the people on the team.<br>
3. Lack of experience on building a Chrome extension.<br>

#Mitigation strategy:<br><br>
1. Learn Java and how to make Chrome extension from online tutorial<br>
2. Allocate the works properly based on each member's experience on Java.<br>
3. Hold group meeting oftenly<br>

#User stories:<br><br>
1. As a student, I want to manage many chrome tabs at once so that I can be more efficient at researching while working on assignments.<br>

2. As a user, I want my tabs to be organized so that I can quickly find what I am looking for. <br>

3. As a user, I want to see the full title of all my tabs in one place so that I can decide whether to to close them or keep them open quickly.<br>

4. As a user, I want to temporarily save my tabs without bookmarking so that I can continue a browsing experience where I left off when I want to.<br>  

5. As a developer, I want to utilize an environment that has clear and extensive documentation so that development does not waste time.<br>     
6. As a non-associated developer, I want to be able to see the software's code so I can give constructive feedback to make the extension better.<br>  
 #Project Tracking software: <br><br>
 1. we will use the Trello to track our project. Here is the link: https://trello.com/b/PyUQHOBa/group-project-for-csci3308
 
 #Automated Tests: <br><br>
 1. Because our project is a Chrome Web extension which we need serval different language to achieve it such as HTML, CSS, Javacript, so it's hard to find one automated test online. Therefore if we want to test it, then input some data and so the website. <br>
